    "# Introduction to cardiac cell models\n",
    "\n",
    "In short a cell is an object that contains two different compartments separated by a wall. We usually refer the the inside of the cell as the intracellular space, the outside of the cell as the extracellular space and the wall separating the two compartments as the cell membrane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ions flow in and out of the cell through channels, usually refferred to as ion channels. These channels can be open of closed depending of different mechanicsms that we will get to. Example of ions that flow between the extracellular and intracellular space are sodium (), potassium (), Calcium ( and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the ions are charged there it is possible that the net charge of the intracellular space is different from the charge of the extracellular space. This results in a gradient which will try to balance the charge in a way that charge of intracellular and extracellular space becomes the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time the concentrations of the different ions might also differ between the intracellular and extracellular space. This in turn will result in a another gradient that will try to balance the consentration.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should therefore be clear that we have two driving forces, one for the charge and another for the concentration that battles in order to equlize the charge and concentration respectively between the intracellular and extracellular space. This battle usually results in a comprimise between the two driving forces which sets up a potential difference between the intracellular and extracellular space. This potential difference is called the membrane potential, because it is the potential difference over the membrane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these ion channels respond to changes in the membrane potential, and such channels are called voltage-gated channels. For example the sodium channel opens when the membrane potential reaches a certain threshold which allows sodium to flow into the cell. This will further create an unbalance which will make the membrane potiental go sky high. This is reffered to as the upstroke. Luckiliy there are other channels that open and close in response to changes in the membrane potential that will force the membrane potiential down agains. For example voltage-gated calcium channels allows calium to flow into the cell since the concentration of calcium in the extracellular space is much greater than in the intracellular space. This increased concentration of calcium inside the cell is what ultimately results in the cell contraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of cells in the heart. In some cells the membrane potiental changes spontanoulsy, and we usually refer to these cells as pacemaker cells. Other types of cells can only fire when stimulated by an electric signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the heart the cells are connected and the action potential will travel from one cell to the next. In this way, the pacemaker cells can trigger an electric wave which traveles through the whole heart and thereby changes the membrane potential of all the cells in the heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example let us use a common model of human heart cells known as the tenTusscher model"

    "## The action potential\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to the intracellular and extracellular potential as $V_i$ and $V_e$ respectively. Note that a potential must be measured realtive to someting and we assume that $V_i$ and $V_e$ are measured relative to some common ground lead. The membrane potential is thus the potiential differece between the intracellular and extracellular space\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = V_i - V_e$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The resting membrane potential is typically around -70 mV (ref??). This means that the potential in the intrecellular space is lower than in the extrecellular space. \n",
    "\n",
    "As been noted, the membrane potential arises from a separatio of the intrecellular and extracelluar space by a membrane. The intrecellular medium, called the cytoplasm and the extracellular medium contains different concentraion of various ions. The most important ions are sodium (Na$^{+}$), potassium (K$^{+}$) and Calcium (Ca$^{2+}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The membrane, which is about 5nM (ref??) is composed of a lipid bilayer, i.e two layers of lipids which have one hydrophilic end pointing outwards, and one hydrophobic end pointing inwards. The membrane is virtually impermable to water and ions, meaning that it can seprate positive ions on one side and negative ions on the other side, which leads to an electric field across the membrane. From a modeling perspective we can think of this as electrical capasitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ion channels are pores in the lipid bilayer, which allows specific ions to flow through the membrane. For example ion channels that are mostly permeable to potassium are called potassium channels. Some of these ion channles can exist in different states; they can be open meaning that ions can flow through or closed, meaning that ions cannot flow through. Such channels are usually referred to as activate channels, wheras channels than does not change the pemeability is reffered to as passive states. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ion pumps is a different protien stucture that primarly pumps specific ions in and out of the cell. One example is the sodium-potassium pump which pumps potassium (2 K$^{+}$) into the cell sodium (3 Na$^{+}$) out of the cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Electrodiffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Ions that flow through the membrane can lead to an electric field, i.e an electric force resulting for different charges in the intrecellular and extracellular space. At the same time, concentration differences leads to diffusion of ions for the space with higher concentration to the space with lower concentration. This combination of electric forces and diffusion is called electrodiffusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following we will look at a specific ion (or moelcule) $X$ with an intracellular concentration $X_i$ and extracellular concentration $X_e$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffusion is the process that moves particle from regions of high concentrations to region of low concentration. A steady state solution is obtained when all regions have equal concentration. Given an arbitrary molecule $X$, with different concentrations $[X]$ in the intracellular and extracellular space will have a flux of iouns described by *Ficks law*\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ J_{X, \\text{diff}}  =  -D_X \\frac{\\mathrm{d}[X]}{\\mathrm{d}x}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $J_{X, \\text{diff}}$ is the flux, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}[X]}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ is the concentration gradient and $D_X$ is the diffusion coefficient determining how easy it is for ions to flow through the membrane. The negative sign\n",
    "indicates that the flux is in the opposite direction to that in which the concentration gradient increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Electric forces\n",
    "\n",
    "The contribution of flow of ions throug the membrance coming from the electric field is given by *Planck's equation*\n",

    "The diffusion coeffeicient can be further be written as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ D_X = \\frac{ u R T }{F |z_X|} $$\n",

    "### The Nernst-Planck equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The total flux of ions of type $X$ across the membrane is therefore\n",
